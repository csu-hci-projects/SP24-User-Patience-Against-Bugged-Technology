# Overview
For this project, our work was very evenly distributed, with no one member doing the majority of the work overall. We did end up having one of us who wrote the majority of one part of the project, with Mari taking the lead with the bulk of our code, Tegan taking the lead with our paper and it's formatting, and Ri taking on much of the code's documentation, and the saving/analysis of our data.
